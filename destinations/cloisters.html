	<h2>What is The Cloisters?</h2>
	<p>The Cloisters is one of the many MET museums across the city and houses some <strong><em>very impressive</em></strong> medieval European art and architecture as well as a cozy garden and snack area.  What's also great about visiting the Cloisters is that you can also take a stroll through nearby Fort Tryon Park.</p>
