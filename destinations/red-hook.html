	<p>New York City can be a hectic and bustling place.  But with a little bit of effort you can escape the crowds and experience a different side of the city.</p>

	<h2>How do you get there?</h2>
	<p>Part of the reason that Red Hook is quieter than the rest of the city is that it's not very easy to get to!  Since most New Yorkers don't have a car and with no convenient subway or bus lines, the way most people get to and from Red Hook is via the IKEA ferry.</p>

	<h2>What is there to do?</h2>
	<p>There is a surprising amount of great places to eat and drink so I've created a check-list of my favorite places below.</p>
