	<h2>What is The High Line?</h2>
	<p>The High Line is located in Lower Manhattan and is an outdoor park that was converted from an old elevated train line that ran down the west side of Manhattan. There are many types of indigenous plants, plenty of seating areas, scenic viewpoints, and food carts.</p>

	<p>Here are a few of my favorite spots along the route!</p>
